# Project 01 BugCatcher
 Using Maven, Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber,Gherkin, I was able to create and define  some test cases for  a web application
 That I've received feature files to work. The web application, "Bug Catcher", focus in tests cases and bug-reporting
 management system.
In this project I created a RTM (Requirement Traceability Matrix), with Test Case Documents and  a Defect Report Documents As well, with information gained throughout the project.
